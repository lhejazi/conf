handy configuration files

vim plugins include:

-Align
-NERDTree
-matchit
-Checksyntax
-snipit (?) - not sure about this one

The script "sprunge" and "cap" are really useful scripts to have in your
bin that will take a file/picture and post it on a random site on the internet
that you can then share with others! This is especially handy in case you 
want to show fellow groupmembers code without sending it to them in an
email or through attachments....

just go

$ sprunge <filename>

and your code will be online!

My bin needs to be updated...
